DESCRIPTION: Enable mediakeys when on Deezer but also from
other tabs.

HOW DOES IT WORK:
When the content script execute into a tab, listen
for every key that is pressed. When it does catch your multimedia
keys, it sends a request to the background part, asking if the
current tab is Deezer. If it is, it executes the command
directly on the current page (useful for not looping through tabs
when you're on Deezer, or when you use Deezer as a Web App),
otherwise it loop through tabs of each window and, when it does find
the first deezer window (or tab), it sends the command directly
to it (without losing the focus over your current tab).
It DOES send a message only TO THE FIRST window or tab that it find,
which it mean that if you have multiple deezer windows or tabs,
it will work only to the first you opened, not to the others.
